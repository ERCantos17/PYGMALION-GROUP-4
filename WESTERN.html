	<H1> What we have learned in ICT </H1> 
	<p class="content">Information and Communication Technology more commonly known as ICT, has permeated nearly every aspect of modern life, from the way we get around to the way we do business, from the computers and phones we use to the way we shop and more.In education it is the mode of that use information and communications technology to support, enhance, and optimise the delivery of information.They said  that ICT can lead to improved student learning and better teaching methods. From the past few months of studying the subject “ ICT” we have been learn alot of things including or like HTML is it  important in your first step in your web development and HTML provides the content that gives web pages structure, by using elements and tags, you can add text, images, videos, forms, and more. CSS what we have learn in CSS is to create unique web layouts and styling our html elements. CSS is will gives us stylistic information for our web and to know the size and font we will use. And the similarities of Hypertext Markup and Cascading Style Sheet is is they both use to design a web pages and their differences is html  is to create static  web pages while css is responsible for the presentation of the documents.So this is the step by step of making html document if you have a plan to make  First type the < ! DOCTYPE html > it is the important part when you making html, second is HTML structure wrap your entire HTML content with html tag like,<title> closing </title>,<body></body>,<html></html> this is the some of the example of what you called tag, third is head section contains meta-information about the documents fourth is title tag with the head section to define the title of your Web page. The body section contains the actual content of your webpage. Use HTML elements such as headings head one, head two, paragraphs symbolize p. Alternative text for images (alt attribute), and following accessibility guidelines. for the last part of your every tags that you make is you need to use this ( / ) symbolize that you closing your tags don’t forget that symbol because when you making html one mistake can affect your whole html. Let’s proceed to URL Uniform Resource Locator) when we say URL is the address of a unique resource on the internet. It is one of the key mechanisms used by browsers to retrieve published resources, such as HTML pages, CSS documents, images. URL will tell us creator, audience, purpose, and sometimes country of origin. URL shows aspects of a website, and the use of a good URL structure makes it easier for search engine crawlers to pinpoint specific pages. So let’s moved on to the Domain when we say domain is like every computer has its own unique address, every user using the Internet has a unique address called domain. A domain recognizes one or more IP addresses. The standard of the top-level domains  or some common  endings  to web addresses are com - Commercial business, edu - Educational institutions , gov - Government agencies ,mil - Military, net - Networks organization, and org - Organizations (nonprofit). And you might see addresses that may add a country code to the last part of the address such as ca-Canada, uk- United Kingdom, fr-France, us-United States of America,and au- Austrialia. And here’s the commonly used internet terms  that you always hear  and use to locate is browsers,dowloading, uploading,link hypetext/ link hyperlink, blog, firewall, malware,and phising. As a grade 10 student studying ICT is a way to us to prefer for SHS because some of us one to be IT. We also found out how it is important that we have knowledge about internet especially that we are Generation Z .We have learned a lot like how to make our account protected and safe for some people we called hackers.</p>
